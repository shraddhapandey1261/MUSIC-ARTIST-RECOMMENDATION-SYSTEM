# MUSIC-ARTIST-RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM

The project aims to identify correlations between users and music artists in order to offer new artist suggestions to users based on their prior interactions with those artists. To accomplish this, the project will use a sample dataset of music artists and utilize several libraries including NumPy, Pickle, and Pandas.

The TfidfVectorizer and Cosine Similarity methods will be used to analyze the dataset and identify correlations between users and artists. TfidfVectorizer is a technique used to convert text data into numerical data, which can then be used for analysis. Cosine Similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them.

The project will also include a Flask frontend, which will display the suggested artist when a particular artist is processed. Flask is a micro web framework for Python that allows for the creation of web applications.

Overall, this project will use a combination of data analysis techniques, machine learning libraries, and web development tools to identify correlations between users and music artists and provide personalized artist suggestions to users.
